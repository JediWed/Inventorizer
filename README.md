#Inventorizer

Inventorizer is a smart tool to track your inventory of your department, organization or your private inventory. You can create categories, items of any category and lend them. You can track when was an item lent, who lent it, when the item is expected back and a lot more.

## Inventorizer needs following infrastructure

* Webserver for WebApp - This is written in JavaScript so no PHP or Pearl is needed
* Backend Server with Linux, Windows, macOS also a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian is possible
* iOS Device for scanning and updating devices when some status update happens (e.g. Item was brought back or was lent)
